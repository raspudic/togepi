# Iman Radjavi - Week 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
Since I was registered to the course on Friday (March 29), I haven’t had the time to work with my team yet. This is something that will change from Week 2, so the plan is to have a discussion with my team so that I can catch up on what has been done so far. 

Because I missed the first couple of lectures, I will look back at the lecture slides to learn and understand what the course is all about, as well as learning the concepts of the course, such as Scrum.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
My strengths are in the technical areas, such as programming. Therefore my intentions are that everyone in the group should be able to work with everything, so if someone is struggling in an area where I might have some knowledge, I will make sure that they do not get stuck.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Because of my late registration to the course, I will have to pass these questions for this week.
