# MATEO - INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION - WEEK :hash: 1

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I have read about Scrum and Kanban prior to this course, but never really used it up until now. 
I am looking forward to learning about proper project management and using an agile approach to conduct this project.
To make sure that I do this right, I am going to research agile management frameworks and learn about them before starting the project for real.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I am lucky to have a team where every member has good experiences in their respective fields. 
We are a mixed SE/CSE/IE group and I think everybody can learn something from the others. 
The best way for me to help someone else learn something new is to share my progress with the rest of the group during our weekly meetings.
This is especially important because we will most likely be working in subgroups with different parts of the project and to enable the rest of the team to help with my part, it would be critical to share my progress continuously.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Since this was the first week of the project, we have not really applied SCRUM yet, with the exception of the LEGO exercise. 
I cannot say that I have contributed with more than my presence during the exercises. 
I have, however, read up on Scrum and will be able to relay this information to my team. 
I also plan to make sure that we follow the guidelines set by the examiner and that we do not take any shortcuts. 
A daily Scrum would be great, but it would be hard to pull off because of our different schedules. 
Perhaps we can catch up very quickly through messages on Slack.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
So far, we have not had any deliveries because this is the first week. 
I have, however, brought a few ideas to the table and also helped further the thought process and discussion on the other team members' ideas.
This includes the discussion about which frameworks to use.
I have also attended the lectures and exercises, with the exception of on Friday because of other plans.
Another thing I have provided and can keep providing is a room for the meetings that I also use together with my organization.
Lastly, I created the repo and the Messenger group for the initial contact between the team. Slack is however better because we can have a more structured chat and things do not get lost.
I believe that the Messenger group is still good for quick nonimportant questions, e.g. asking the whereabouts of the team when we are meeting.
Because of my background in programming I believe that I can help decide on what language(s)/framework(s) etc. to use when developing our product.

## Thoughts on the coming week.
I am really looking forward to getting started with everything. We have a really good idea and I feel that the team is on the same level.
