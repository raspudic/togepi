# MATEO - INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION - WEEK :hash: 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I am looking forward to getting started with React Native. 
This week I have set up a workspace on my computer, but I have not done any coding so far. 
Learning React Native has always been a goal of mine, and now I will hopefully learn by doing.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
With my experience as a lab supervisor, hopefully I will be able to teach coding etiquette to those that have not done a lot of coding in the past.
I also have some experience with JavaScript that I will be able to share with my team.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
This week, we have divided our app into user stories and tasks. We sat together during the supervision and decided on user stories and effort.


## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As above, I was helping with the user stories and dividing them further into tasks. 
I have also been active during our meetings and discussions.
