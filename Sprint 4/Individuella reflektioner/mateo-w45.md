# MATEO - INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION - WEEK :hash: 4 & 5

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I never got to start coding this week because my computer has been broken. 
I have noticed that setting effort is not the easiest task, and this week we overestimated our user story.
This led to finishing early with our tasks and not knowing exactly how to proceed.
Because of this, I would like to read up on sprint planning, and I guess that the best way to learn how to set effort is to keep practicing during the project.
Next week I also look forward to getting started with the actual coding of the app and learning that process together with UX design etiquette.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week, I cannot say that I have taught anyone anything. 
Next week, I think that working together in smaller teams and exchanging thoughts will help the learning process. 
This goes for both learning Scrum and actual coding.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have been active during the sprint planning and helped set effort on User Stories and decided on tasks for each story.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As I mentioned, my computer broke and I had to get it fixed, so I have not managed to do any coding. When I got my computer back, I went abroad for a week and could not participate in person. 
However, I sat with a group member and was giving my input on the user story we were working on. I have also been as active as I could have been on Slack. Next week, I have a lot of time to spare, and I am planning on using this time on the project.
