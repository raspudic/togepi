# MATEO - INDIVIDUAL REFLECTION - WEEK :hash: 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I am looking forward to setting up user stories and learning how to use Scrum during the coding part of the project. 
Until now, we have not used the full extent of Scrum since there has been very limited leeway.
The tasks we have done so far have been very straight forward, and an agile approach this early would be to throw a spanner in the works.
However, the coding part will begin next week and it's going to be great to get some practical experience and learn Scrum and the art of writing good user stories.
In order to do so, we have to sit down together as a team and decide on the functionality and estimate the velocity.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
First, we will have to decide on what framework(s)/language(s) to use in order to develop our app. 
I believe I can help the team make a decision here given my background in programming and my (limited) experience in app development.
I know that some team members have less experience with programming, and that is why it is important to divide the work in the most fruitful way for everyone.
When we divide ourselves into smaller groups working on different tasks, we will have to include a little bit of everything for everyone so that we learn as much as possible.
I believe I can help with the programming part, and I think that my experience as a supervisor in the Data structures and Algorithms course will be pedagogically helpful.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We are in a early stage of the project and we have not really applied Scrum fully yet. 
In the group, I gave my input on the modelling of the Trello board that we will use. 
Other than that, I was present during the "Slicing the cake" exercise.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I am very passionate about design and minimalism in art. In my free time, I use Photoshop to create different concepts and logos.
Because of this, I was eager to design the mock-up and make it as aesthetic as possible.
I made the "expresso" logo in Photoshop with input from the team and I spent a lot of my free time on the mock-up, and learned quite a bit about UI/UX design in the process.
The tool that we used for the prototype was very straightforward yet powerful, but the hard part was creating a prototype that we can use as reference when we create our app.




## Thoughts on the coming week.
I really believe in our team and our idea, and I am looking forward to getting everything started.
I talked about the idea with one of my friends and he recommended that we should speak to the CEO of Chalmers Studentkårs Restaurangbolag about our project.
Apparently, there has been talks to implement reusable cups in the cafés.
