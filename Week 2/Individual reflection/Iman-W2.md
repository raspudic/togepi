# Iman Radjavi :thought_balloon: Week 2

## What do I want to learn or understand better?
I would like to learn some more about the business parts of the project, such as the BMC, user stories etc, since I do not have much knowledge in those areas. I will do this by looking up the concepts and also ask the members of my team that already have knowledge in these areas.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I have a background and hobby of working with design, I took the opportunity to share some of my knowledge with the rest of the team, such as giving some inspiration, sharing links and also contributing to the mockup.

I also have some knowledge of working with different kinds of technologies, such as Google Firebase, which I suggested that we use. I will help my team to understand the concepts of such technologies.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We haven't started using Scrum yet, but I spent some time looking into the concepts of Scrum so that we can start using it next week.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have contributed with some ideas for the development stack that we will use, such as using Google Firebase for authentication etc. I have also contributed in delivering the mockup that we used for the pitch, by designing some of the components using Figma.

The next step is to start developing the application and I will help my team both with the design of the application, as well as the coding.
